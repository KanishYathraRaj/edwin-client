# Edwin

Edwin is an AI-powered assistant designed to help teachers automate and streamline their daily workflows.  
It combines **agentic AI capabilities** with **deterministic workflows** to balance flexibility, reliability, and efficiency.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Teachers spend significant time on repetitive and administrative tasks such as lesson planning, content preparation, and assignment management.  
Existing tools are either too rigid or overly autonomous, leading to inefficiency and lack of control.

---

## 💡 Solution

Edwin addresses this by using a **hybrid architecture**:
- Agentic AI handles open-ended tasks that require reasoning and adaptation.
- Deterministic workflows manage repetitive, rule-based tasks where predictability is critical.

This approach reduces manual effort while maintaining trust and consistency.

## ✨ Key Features

- AI-assisted lesson planning and content generation  
- Workflow-based task automation for recurring teacher activities  
- Tool-driven agent execution with controlled decision-making  
- Context-aware assistance with minimal manual input

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

- **LLM Layer**: Handles reasoning, suggestions, and language-based tasks  
- **Workflow Engine**: Executes predefined, deterministic task flows  
- **Tool Layer**: APIs and utilities used by agents during execution  
- **State Management**: Maintains task context and execution state

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- TypeScript / JavaScript  
- Node.js  
- LLM API integration  
- Custom workflow orchestration  
- Firebase
